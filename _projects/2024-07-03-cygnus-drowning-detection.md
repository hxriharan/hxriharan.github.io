## Project Overview
Cygnus is an innovative UAV-based system designed to detect drowning incidents in real time using vision-based techniques. By fusing RGB and infrared imagery and deploying a YOLOv8 model on GAP8 edge microcontrollers onboard drones, Cygnus enables robust monitoring even in low-light or complex aquatic environments.

## Technologies Used
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, YOLOv8, IR/RGB fusion
- **Edge Computing:** GAP8 microcontrollers
- **Communication:** LoRa-based wireless sensor network
- **Hardware:** UAV drones, Intel RealSense cameras
- **Software:** Python, IoT integration

## Key Features
- Real-time drowning detection with 95% precision
- Multi-sensor fusion (RGB + infrared imagery)
- Edge computing implementation for onboard processing
- Autonomous drone routing and altitude adjustment
- LoRa WAN coordination for drone-to-drone communication
- Web dashboard for lifeguard interface

## Results
- **Precision:** 95%
- **Mean Average Precision (mAP):** 83%
- **Dataset:** 1000 annotated aquatic activity images
- **Deployment:** Successfully tested in aquatic environments

## Publications
- **Conference:** 2024 2nd International Conference on Recent Trends in Microelectronics, Automation, Computing and Communications Systems (ICMACC)
- **Paper:** [Cygnus: A Vision-Based Drone System for Drowning Detection Using IoT](/files/cygnus-drowning-detection.pdf)

## Project Impact
This system enhances water safety by providing rapid response during emergencies and enabling continuous monitoring of aquatic environments. The modular architecture makes it adaptable for various surveillance applications beyond drowning detection.
